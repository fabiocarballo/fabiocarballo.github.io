<article class=post__content>
<p>Recently, I have gotten to know about <em>Hyrum&rsquo;s Law</em>, when reading <em>Software Engineering at Google</em>. This is an informal law that was raised in the early days of Google and states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be dependend on by somebody</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This law has quite several implications in different areas of software engineering, such as testing, deprecation, and domain modelling - and it directly impacts the code &ldquo;maintainability&rdquo; - since it indicates that the documented and tested behaviors may be a subset of all the expected behaviors.</p>
<img src=/hyrum_law_set.png style=width:50%>
<p>This can be troublesome during API refactor and migrations, since the APIs have hidden &ldquo;expected&rdquo; behaviors that we might break during refactors or eliminate in a migration. For example, largers companies perform planned outages to identify unexpected dependencies and usages of entire systems.</p>
<p>It was then fun, when I encountered a really good example of this law in action, and realized how important good domain modelling can help to decrease the possibility of unexpected observable behaviors - which should lead to more predictable software development.</p>
<h2 id=example-loading-products-by-category>Example: Loading products by category<a class=anchor href=#example-loading-products-by-category>#</a></h2>
<p>In this example, we examine the development of a real-life situation I encountered. The system under test is one where we are <em>loading a list of products of a given category</em>. For that, we have three particularly important abstractions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GetProductsUseCase</code></li>
<li><code>ProductsRepository</code></li>
<li><code>ProductsApi</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Below, you can see the high-level picture of how each one depends on the other. It should then be clear that <code>GetProductsUseCase</code> is part of our <code>domain</code> layer, while <code>ProductsRepository/Api</code> is part of our data layer.</p>
<p><img src=/hyrum_law_example_schema.png style=margin-top::16px></p>
<p>The classes definition were following these wireframes:</p>
<pre><code class=language-kotlin>interface ProductsApi {

	fun getProducts(category: String): List&lt;RawProduct&gt;
}

class ProductsRepository(api: ProductsApi) {
	
	fun getProducts(category: String): List&lt;ProductDto&gt; =
		api.getProducts(category)
			.map { ... }
}

class GetProductsUseCase(repository: ProductsRepository) {

	fun run(category: String) =
		repository.getProducts(category)
			.map { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By looking, at this API, one would expect this fundamental behavior: <em>given a category, I receive a list of products for that category</em>. However, this wasn&rsquo;t what was happening after my <strong>observation</strong>.</p>
<p>When the system was initially developed, that was the expected behavior - give a category in the form of a <code>String</code> and receive a list of products. Hence, the first developers design the API as I declared above and the usage could be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code class=language-kotlin>val products = getProductsUseCase.run(&quot;flowers&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>With time, more and more clients started using this API under the definition of the initial contract.</p>
<p align=center width=100%>
<img src=/hyrum_law_initial_behavior.png style=width:50%>
</p>
<p>However, at later point in time, one of the clients needed a new behavior: <em>given a list of categories, I receive a list of products for those categories</em>. What I imagine it happened, as a series of discussions (along side with time pressure) which resulted in the addition of unexpected behavior to the API and is highlighted in red in the figure below.</p>
<p align=center width=100%>
<img width=50% src=/hyrum_law_end_behavior.png style=width:50%>
</p>
<p>The backend would receive the categories in the form of a comma separated list of categories <code>String</code>. This way, if I wanted the products for categories <code>flowers</code> and <code>books</code>, I would call <code>ProductsApi</code> in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class=language-kotlin>productsApi.getProducts(&quot;flowers,books&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Given that our <code>domain</code> layer also expected a <code>category: String</code>, the new client just started passing <code>"category1,category2"</code> at that level, and things just worked because now the server was updated to deal with that behavior. However, this is a clear leak of an implementation detail of the server into our app&rsquo;s domain layer. And with this subtle gain of flexibility, suddenly the behavior of our whole system has changed, without a single line change in our codebase. Unfortunately, this change went under the radar, because no tests showcased this behavior nor documentation about it was added.</p>
<p>I only have realized about this fact once I try to enforce more structured domain modeling, by adding a <code>value class</code> for <code>Category</code>. After it, I tried to migrate client by client, to only realize that one of those was not using the API was the initial developers intended to.</p>
<h2 id=better-domain-modelling-to-the-rescue>Better domain modelling to the rescue<a class=anchor href=#better-domain-modelling-to-the-rescue>#</a></h2>
<p>It is then easy to conclude that if the domain layer had from the start a more &ldquo;closed&rdquo; domain by using a <code>Category</code> value class this suble change of API would have been caught, and properly dealt with.</p>
<p>One could have modelled the <code>Category</code> to enforce some basic validations:</p>
<pre><code class=language-kotlin>inline class Category(val value: String) {
   init {
     require(value.hasOnlyLetters()) { 
     	&quot;The given value is not a valid category since it has non alphabetic characters&quot; }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever, the faulty client would try to create a <code>Category("flowers,drinks")</code>, this error would have been caught and they would be forced refactor the API accordingly to:</p>
<pre><code>class GetProductsUseCase(...) {
  fun run(categories: List&lt;Category&gt;): List&lt;Product&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this was a good effort to one more reason on why good domain modeling is important.</p>
