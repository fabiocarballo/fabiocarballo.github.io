In my vision, we would be able to only write one single test, but automatically generate the screenshots for all the themes in one single run
Meanwhile, I reached a solution that can be seen in this sample project created for this purpose.</description></item><item><title>Testing Hybrid Apps Flows with emptyComposeRule</title><link>https://fabiocarballo.github.io/blog/testing-hybrid-app-flows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 11:17:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fabiocarballo.github.io/blog/testing-hybrid-app-flows/</guid><description>Recently, we have migrated one of our app screens to Compose - in an experiment that reduced the UI layer codebase by 60%. However, by the time we wanted to test our app we found a problem.
At work, we have a small set of critical tests that we run as pure E2E tests. Therefore, every test starts by launching the app and traverse several different screens to verify that its expectations are met.</description></item></channel></rss>
